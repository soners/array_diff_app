[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soners/array_diff_app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soners/array_diff_app)

This array_diff algorithm takes 2 string arraylist as parameter, a boolean and an int parameter. If boolean is true than it returns the array of strings that first array contains and second does not, if it is false than it returns the array of strings that first array does not contain and second array does.
You can limit this strings by giving last parameter value.
